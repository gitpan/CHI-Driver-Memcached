NAME
    CHI::Driver::Memcached -- Distributed cache via memcached (memory cache
    daemon)

SYNOPSIS
        use CHI;

        my $cache = CHI->new(
            driver => 'Memcached',
            namespace => 'products',
            servers => [ "10.0.0.15:11211", "10.0.0.15:11212", "/var/sock/memcached",
            "10.0.0.17:11211", [ "10.0.0.17:11211", 3 ] ],
            debug => 0,
            compress_threshold => 10_000,
        );

DESCRIPTION
    A CHI driver that uses Cache::Memcached to store data in the specified
    memcached server(s).

CONSTRUCTOR OPTIONS
    Namespace, and any constructor options not recognized by CHI, are passed
    along to Cached::Memcached->new. For example:

    compress_threshold
    debug
    no_rehash
    servers
METHODS
    memd
        Returns a handle to the underlying Cache::Memcached object. You can
        use this to call memcached-specific methods that are not supported
        by the general API, e.g.

            $self->memd->incr("key");
            my $stats = $self->memd->stats();

UNSUPPORTED METHODS
    These standard CHI methods cannot currently be supported by memcached.

    dump_as_hash
    get_keys
    get_namespaces
    is_empty
    purge
